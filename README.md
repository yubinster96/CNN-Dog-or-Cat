Used CNN on a data set (with seperate input and label files) that contains images of dogs and cats. 

Resized/formatted the pictures into proper dimensions so the models would run properly.

Used simple Conv2D as well as 2D pooling (both two times) in the CNN model.

Ran 5 epoch tests

Also did a seperate prediction at the end with a simple if and else function to test seperately with random images put in as input.

Files too big to upload.. Training file had 2000 images
