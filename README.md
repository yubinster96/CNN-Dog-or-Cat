Used CNN on a data set (with seperate input and label files) that contains images of dogs and cats. 

Resized/formatted the pictures into proper dimensions so the models would run properly.

Used simple Conv2D as well as 2D pooling (both two times) in the CNN model.

Ran 5 epoch tests

Accuracy test results from epoch tests were not that high, because we ran so little tests. Can run more to get more accurate results.

Also did a seperate prediction at the end with a simple if and else function to test seperately with random images put in as input. Considering the model we used and little testing we did, it was still quite accuracte.

Files too big to upload.. Training file had 2000 images
